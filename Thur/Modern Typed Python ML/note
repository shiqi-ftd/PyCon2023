Typing in Python - is python typed? It's duck typed

def add(x, y):
    return x + y

Pros: Simple, Concise, 

Cons: Hard to maintain, Fail at Runtime instead of Compile Time 

Python Type hints in ML


Hints:
1. Communication with Coworkers, Future Self, includes
2. Find bugs early (w additional tooling)
3. Compatible with duck typing

PEP - Python Enhancement Proposal
Python1,2,3.0 no type hints -> Python3 PEP3107 with Annotation(!= hints)
-> 2014 Py3.5 PEP484 Typing!


Mypy - static type checking
Beartype - runtime checking
* Pydantic - Data validation using type hints
FastAPI is based on Pydantic vs Flask
SQLModel - based on Pydantic
...

What about ML framework?

Jaxtyping - checks the shape and dtype of Arrays - doesn't work with Pydantic
